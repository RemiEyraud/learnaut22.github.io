    Cookie Monster is a blue Muppet character on the long-running PBS/HBO children's television show Sesame Street.
    In a song in 2007, and later in an interview in 2017, Cookie Monster revealed that his real name is Sidney Monster.
    He is best known for his voracious appetite and his famous eating catchphrases, such as "Me want cookie!" Although he eats almost anything, including normally inedible objects, as his name suggests, his preferred food is cookies.
    Chocolate chip cookies are his favorite kind.
    Despite his voracious appetite for cookies, Cookie Monster shows awareness of healthy eating habits for young children and also enjoys fruits and eggplant.
